The fixture list has been released. Manchester Utd against Swansea City is how Manchester Utd will begin their campaign on the opening day.
11_1_5
Fixtures Announced for Manchester Utd
Simone Scuffet is a name on the lips of many who watch Udinese.
The goalkeeper from Italy is attracting a lot of attention from around the league for his performances this season. The 185 cm stopper has attracted rave reviews when he's had an opportunity to play and many believe he could go on to build an international career. But that remains some way in the future and, for now, the right footed young keeper needs to play regularly for his club and establish himself. Until then, numerous clubs will undoubtedly monitor his progress and whoever moves first might find themselves landing a player of real class.

One for the Future: Simone Scuffet - Udinese
Manchester Utd released a list of confirmed clubs they will take on for pre-season friendlies. The fixtures confirmed are against Bayer 04, Montpellier HSC, and finally FC Lorient.

Manchester Utd Friendly Opponents Announced
After putting pen to paper to take the reins of Manchester Utd, Gaffer was asked by local media whether he will be interested in managing a national team in addition to his club duties. 
That would be a huge honour. Every manager dreams of shining on the international stage and winning trophies with a national team
, said the manager, adding that 
it would be very special for me if one day I can manage my home nation and bring joy to my country, but for now I need to focus on the next task, and that is to have a successful campaign with Manchester Utd
Despite Gaffer's lack of experience, it is not hard to imagine that some national teams will have him on their radar now that he has entered the scene. If he can get off to a good start and string together some wins, there will be no shortage of interest from different football associations looking to hire a coach for the top job.

Gaffer Looking for an Opportunity on the International Stage
In a surprising turn of events, Gaffer has been announced as the new face of Manchester Utd. It is unknown what other candidates may have been approached, with the chairman quoted as saying "He's determined and we are confident his leadership can bring us the success we've been after. We interviewed other managers and in the end we felt that Gaffer was the best fit for our club, our players and the fans."
The appointment of Gaffer by Manchester Utd is a huge gamble by the board who are placing their faith in such an inexperienced manager. "Gaffer has exciting ideas and plans for the club. He shares the players passion and hunger so we believe he will be the right man for the job. Experience doesn't always guarantee results" were the words of the club chairman during the recent press conference.
Gaffer will have to skip the celebration as the season is fast approaching and starting strong will be key to winning over skeptical Manchester Utd fans. World class teams like Manchester Utd come with world class expectations and only time will tell if he'll be the next great boss to leave his mark on Manchester Utd history.

Manchester Utd Ponder New Boss Gaffer
The transfer window is open. Fans are wondering which players their club will bring in or sell before the deadline on August 31.
Transfer Window Opens
Manchester City have signed 27-year old wide man Jes
s Navas from Sevilla FC for a fee in the region of $32,500,000. The Manchester City Manager was delighted to have captured Jes
s Navas from under the noses of a number of clubs and looks to his new signing giving his team a welcome boost during the season. 
The Manchester City boss said "Our fans are in for a treat with this lad. He's going to be a great addition to this club and I can see him fitting in perfectly with what we are trying to achieve in this organisation."

FC Bayern have announced on their official website that they have completed the transfer of Mario G
tze from Bor. Dortmund for a fee of $65,500,000. The 21-year old attacking midfielder from Germany enjoyed a fruitful spell at his former club, Bor. Dortmund, and joins his new team-mates with a glowing reputation as a player who can add a little something extra to any team he plays for.
His new manager was over the moon with his new signing. "I can't wait to get him in the team and start working with him. He is going to give us a big boost and the extra motivation that we have been sorely lacking in recent weeks," he said outside the club's training facilities.
Initial reports suggest that the player will receive a $190,000 salary in his new club.

Juventus have completed the signing of Carlos T
vez after Manchester City accepted a bid in the region of $47,000,000 for the 29-year old striker. 
The player, who agreed on a $240,000 weekly salary, was presented to the press at the club's training centre earlier. "Juventus are a team that are going places and I'm pleased to be on board. I'm so happy to join such a prestigious club" T
vez said. "I will do my best to earn for myself a place in the first eleven. The boss and his back room staff have every confidence in me and I can't wait to repay their faith" he added.

Fiorentina have signed Germany born striker Mario Gomez from FC Bayern. Club representatives have confirmed that the deal was worth around $50,500,000 and the player will complete a medical in the coming days.
The 27-year old's arrival at Fiorentina is sure to shake up the squad and have a few players looking nervously over their shoulder. "Every club needs competition for places and ours is no different," said a resolute manager, "I want to keep pushing my lads to give one hundred percent every match and to do that they need to know their places are always under threat. The signing of Gomez is a signal of my intent."

The PSG boss said "Our fans are in for a treat with this lad. He's going to be a great addition to this club and I can see him fitting in perfectly with what we are trying to achieve in this organisation."
